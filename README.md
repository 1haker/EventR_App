# EventR_App

Application created as an Engineering Thesis at the Bia≈Çystok University of Technology.

The purpose of the work is to create a bilingual mobile application supporting the player in "League of Legends". 
The created application, using the API provided by the developers of the game (RIOT company), 
will allow you to view statistics, 
search for players (viewing recently played pastimes with the option of selecting a given match and 
displaying its details) and information about the characters (with a detailed description). 
The application will use GPS to determine the region in which the player is currently located. In addition, 
you'll be able to publish posts to help find players to play together.
